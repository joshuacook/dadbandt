- A Monome grid
- A Norns shield
- A 1010music Blackbox sampler
- A Teenage Engineering TX-6
- A Zoom recorder
- Some batteries on the right

A Powell Peralta skateboard deck with a classic winged skull graphic waiting to be the base - just needs more Velcro strips first.

Right now I'm using the Zoom recorder to capture the room sound. I'd rather go directly into the TX-6 but this is what I got right now.
