I've been developing a quantum drum visualizer that uses energy states to generate rhythmic patterns. On the left is a screen shot of the application. On the right is a state transition diagram showing the probabilities of transitioning between different energy states.

## State Distribution Analysis

I'm using data science to verify the system behaves as designed. Here's what I found from analyzing a 60-second simulation.

Running a 60-second simulation with the dual matrix configuration (normal for beats 1-12, ending for beats 13-16), the system showed more diverse state exploration:

- **Ground State**: 32.4% of all notes played
- **Rising State**: 16.8% of notes
- **Active State**: 19.6% of notes
- **Intense State**: 10.1% of notes
- **Peak State**: 8.9% of notes
- **Wild State**: 5.0% of notes
- **Chaos State**: 2.2% of notes
- **Maximum State**: 5.0% of notes
- **281 state transitions** in 60 seconds - 4.7 changes per second

All 8 states were reached during the simulation, showing the system explores the full energy range while still maintaining a gravity toward lower states for musical coherence.

## Beat Distribution Analysis

The beat distribution shows which energy states were active at each beat position throughout the 60-second simulation:

- **Beat 1**: Active state leads (26.7%), showing dynamic starts
- **Beats 2-13**: Ground state dominant (43-70%), maintaining stability
- **Beat 14**: Rising state takes over (53.3%), beginning the climax
- **Beat 15**: Active state dominates (36.7%), peak energy
- **Beat 16**: Rising state leads (30%), transitioning back

The ending matrix (beats 13-16) successfully creates more state diversity and upward movement, while the normal matrix (beats 1-12) maintains rhythmic stability.

## Drum Distribution Analysis

The drum distribution from the 60-second simulation:
- **Kick**: 63 hits (35.2%)
- **Snare**: 67 hits (37.4%)
- **Snare Tight**: 15 hits (8.4%)
- **All hi-hats combined**: 34 hits (19.0%)

The increased state diversity is reflected in the drum usage - hi-hats now represent 19% of hits (up from minimal activity), showing the system explores more complex patterns when reaching higher energy states.

## Transition Behavior Verification

The transition matrix data confirmed the programmed behavior:
- States 1→2 and 2→1 were the most common transitions (62 and 54 times respectively)
- States 2→3 transitions increased (27 times), showing more upward movement
- States 3→1 returns (28 times) maintain stability
- The system reached all 8 states, including Maximum state (5.0% of notes)
- The separate ending matrix (beats 13-16) successfully creates climactic variation without relying on a simple multiplier

## Development Insights

The data analysis validated the design and the new configuration format makes tuning easier:

1. **Dual matrix approach** - Separate normal and ending matrices provide precise control over different pattern sections
2. **Full state exploration** - All 8 states were reached, showing the system uses its full dynamic range
3. **Easy tuning** - The integer-based config (0-9 values) makes adjustments intuitive
4. **Effective endings** - The dedicated ending matrix creates natural climaxes in beats 13-16 without artificial multipliers

## Next Steps

The system behaves as designed - the Markov chain creates the intended musical dynamics. The dual matrix configuration in `transition_matrix_config.json` provides separate control over normal patterns (beats 1-12) and endings (beats 13-16). Simply adjust the 0-9 integer values in either matrix to shape how states transition. The data science approach confirms the core mechanism is sound and ready for creative exploration.
