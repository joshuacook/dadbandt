title: Analyzing Generative Drum Pattern Behavior Through Data Science

I've been developing a quantum drum visualizer that uses energy states to generate rhythmic patterns. I'm using data science to verify the system behaves as designed. Here's what I found from analyzing a 60-second simulation.

## State Distribution Analysis

Running a simulation with basic anchor patterns (kick on 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4), the transition matrix clearly shows higher probabilities for staying in or returning to lower states. The actual distribution confirmed this design:

- **Ground State**: 38.9% of all notes played
- **Maximum state**: Only 2.9% of the time
- **258 state transitions** in 60 seconds - over 4 changes per second

This gravity toward lower states was intentional - the transition matrix was designed to create this behavior for musical coherence.

## Beat Distribution Analysis

The beat distribution shows which energy states were active at each beat position throughout the 60-second simulation:

- **Beat 1** shows the most state diversity (only 23% Ground state, significant Rising/Active/Intense presence)
- **Beats 2-14** are predominantly Ground state (50-77% of the time)
- **Beats 15-16** show increased state diversity again (40% Ground, with more Rising/Active states)

The pattern shows that the system spent most of its time in Ground state across most beat positions, which aligns with the overall 38.9% Ground state distribution and the gravity toward lower states in the transition matrix.

## Drum Distribution Analysis

The drum distribution from the 60-second simulation:
- **Kick**: 67 hits (38.3%)
- **Snare**: 72 hits (41.1%)
- **All hi-hats combined**: 21.5%

The kick and snare dominate because they were set as anchor notes (velocity 200) on beats 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 (kick) and 2, 6, 10, 14 (snare). These anchor notes remain constant across all energy states, which explains their high percentage in the final output.

## Transition Behavior Verification

The transition matrix data confirmed the programmed behavior:
- States 1→2 and 2→1 were the most common (as expected from the matrix)
- Multi-state jumps were rare due to low probabilities in non-adjacent cells
- The ending matrix (3x boost for upward transitions) successfully created climactic endings
- State 7 frequently returned to State 1 due to the high probability in that cell

## Development Insights

The data analysis validated the design but revealed tuning opportunities:

1. **Ground state duration** - Could reduce self-transition probability for more variety
2. **Middle state distinctiveness** - States 3-5 could use more unique characteristics
3. **Anchor attraction** - The 2x multiplier works well but could be state-dependent
4. **Ending boost** - The 3x multiplier creates good climaxes

## Next Steps

The system behaves as designed - the Markov chain creates the intended musical dynamics. Now I can tune parameters based on aesthetic preferences rather than fixing broken behavior. The data science approach confirms the core mechanism is sound.
