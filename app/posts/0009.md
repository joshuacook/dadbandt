I've been developing a quantum drum visualizer that uses energy states to generate rhythmic patterns. On the left is a screen shot of the application. On the right is a state transition diagram showing the probabilities of transitioning between different energy states.

## State Distribution Analysis

I'm using data science to verify the system behaves as designed. Here's what I found from analyzing a 60-second simulation.

Running a 60-second simulation, the transition matrix clearly shows higher probabilities for staying in or returning to lower states. The actual distribution confirmed this design:

- **Ground State**: 59.9% of all notes played
- **Rising State**: 17.5% of notes
- **Active State**: 17.5% of notes
- **Intense State**: 5.1% of notes
- **237 state transitions** in 60 seconds - 3.9 changes per second

This gravity toward lower states was intentional - the transition matrix was designed to create this behavior for musical coherence.

## Beat Distribution Analysis

The beat distribution shows which energy states were active at each beat position throughout the 60-second simulation:

- **Beats 1-10** are heavily dominated by Ground state (50-83% of the time)
- **Beats 11-16** show slightly more diversity but still Ground state dominant (43-60%)
- **Beat 16** shows the most state diversity (43% Ground, more Rising/Active presence)

The pattern shows that the system spent most of its time in Ground state across all beat positions, which aligns with the overall 59.9% Ground state distribution and the strong gravity toward lower states in the transition matrix.

## Drum Distribution Analysis

The drum distribution from the 60-second simulation:
- **Kick**: 67 hits (48.9%)
- **Snare**: 65 hits (47.4%)
- **All hi-hats combined**: 3.6%

The kick and snare completely dominate the output, with very minimal hi-hat activity. This reflects the strong tendency to stay in Ground state, where the pattern is simpler and focused on the fundamental kick-snare rhythm.

## Transition Behavior Verification

The transition matrix data confirmed the programmed behavior:
- States 1→2 and 2→1 were the most common transitions (76 and 75 times respectively)
- States 1→3 and 3→1 were also frequent (28 and 27 times)
- The system rarely reached higher states (only reached State 4 seven times)
- Multi-state jumps were extremely rare due to zero probabilities in non-adjacent cells
- The ending matrix (3x boost for upward transitions) helps create variation

## Development Insights

The data analysis validated the design and the new configuration format makes tuning easier:

1. **Ground state dominance** - The integer matrix (9,3,1,0,0,0,0,0) creates very strong gravity to Ground
2. **Limited state exploration** - Higher states (5-8) were never reached in this simulation
3. **Easy tuning** - The integer-based config (0-9 values) makes adjustments intuitive
4. **Ending boost** - The 3x multiplier still provides upward movement potential

## Next Steps

The system behaves as designed - the Markov chain creates the intended musical dynamics. The new integer-based configuration in `transition_matrix_config.json` makes it easy to experiment with different probability distributions. Simply adjust the 0-9 values in each row to change how states transition. The data science approach confirms the core mechanism is sound and ready for creative exploration.
