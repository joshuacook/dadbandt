Here's a quick demo of the recording setup in action. The video shows how the different components work together:

1. Norns running the beat sequence
2. TX6 handling the mixing
3. R4 capturing audio through its internal mic
4. Blackbox synced with Norns for recording

The workflow is straightforward:
1. Start the beat on Norns
2. Blackbox automatically starts on the next measure
3. R4 captures the room sound
4. Everything stays in sync thanks to the MIDI start/stop messages
