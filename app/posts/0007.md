## Audio Flow

- Room -> R4 -> TX-6 -> Blackbox
- Norns -> TX-6
- Blackbox -> TX-6

## Control flow:
- Norns runs a 16 quarter note grid-based beat program
- Norns controls Blackbox start/stop
- Both start measures together
- Blackbox clip recording:
  - Armed manually
  - Starts automatically on the one
  - Records R4 input from TX6

The Norns is running [palm-tree](https://github.com/joshuacook/palm-tree), a sequencer that uses the grid to create beats.
